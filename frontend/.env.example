# Example frontend env (Create React App)
# Copy to frontend/.env if you need to override API routing.

# When empty, the app relies on CRA's proxy setting in frontend/package.json
# (proxy -> http://localhost:5000) and uses relative /api/* calls.
#
# When deploying frontend separately from backend, set:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
REACT_APP_API_URL=
